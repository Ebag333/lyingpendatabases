<p>The Lying Pen of Scribes: Manuscript Forgeries, Digital Imaging, and Critical Provenance Research is a five-year-long research project financed by the Norwegian Research Council (RCN)’s <a href="https://prosjektbanken.forskningsradet.no/project/FORISS/275293" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FRIPRO Toppforsk</a> call. The project received funding from RCN in 2019 and will be completed in 2024. It was initially centred around the many forgeries of scrolls that started appearing on antiquities markets in 2002.</p>

<p>The post-2002 Dead Sea Scroll-like fragments, and the subsequent publishing of a majority of these disclosed a fundamental crisis in the field of Dead Sea Scrolls and Qumran studies. Leading scholars promoted the fragments, published by some of the most reputable experts in the field; many of the fragments allegedly “survived” advanced physical testing and were authenticated by renowned palaeographers. In other words, none of the major tools in the manuscript expert's toolbox worked, at least not at the outset. The fragments became (and remain) part of the famous Dead Sea Scrolls dataset, even though they are undocumented, unprovenanced, and forged. Traditionally, critical provenance research has been neglected in Qumran studies. Interest in and reflection on provenance has been scarce.</p>

<p>The Lying Pen of Scribes represents a new interdisciplinary and holistic approach to the Dead Sea Scrolls and seeks to create a more comprehensive dataset. The following overarching questions guide the project: (1) What critical insights can be gained from the post-2002 Dead Sea Scrolls scandal, and how can these contribute to changing Qumran studies and manuscript studies at large?</p>
