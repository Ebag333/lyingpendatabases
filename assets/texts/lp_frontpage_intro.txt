<p>The Lying Pen of Scribes project represents a new interdisciplinary and holistic approach to the Dead Sea Scrolls and seeks, among other things, to create a comprehensive, open access dataset to the scrolls. By combining traditional scroll research with digital humanities, the databases on this website provide innovative ways to approach the Dead Sea Scrolls. The databases cover a wide range of topics, e.g.,:</p>

<ul>
<li>	Post-2002 Dead Sea Scroll-like fragments.
<li>	Dead Sea Scrolls exhibitions in the 20th and 21st centuries.
<li>	Colours of the Dead Sea Scroll fragments.
</ul>
